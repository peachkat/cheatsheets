# git reference
`git init`: starts a new git repo on your local machine. (if you used create-react-app, you don't need to do this)

Make a new repo on Github.com, so you can copy the URL:

`git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO.git`

### pushing to git:

`git add .`: adds all files in current folder

`git commit -m "your comment"`: commits!

`git push origin master`: push to github.com!!!

`.gitignore`: this file lets you set which files and folders are ignored by git (create-react-app makes this for you)
